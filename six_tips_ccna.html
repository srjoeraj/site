<h2>Six tips on clearing the 200-301 exam and getting CCNA certified! 🎇 </h2>  
</header>
<article>
<p>I cleared my CCNA over a week ago and am grateful for the congratulatory messages!🙏🏼 A lot of people requested me to share some tips based on my experience, so here we go:</p>

<p>🌟 <strong>Pick the right course for you</strong>: Pick the right course for you: Many great paid and free courses cover the CCNA. It is crucial to pick a course that best suits your learning style. You should go on YouTube, where all significant courses have a selection of free videos available to check which teaching style works you best! I recommend Neil Anderson and Jeremy McDowell's courses on Udemy and YouTube. I also recommend using several resources while you study.</p>

<p>📝 <strong>Take good notes</strong>: This has helped me the most. The CCNA has a vast syllabus covering many topics, from Subnetting to MPLS VPNs. I recommend taking digital notes using Notion, as it allows you to incorporate pictures smoothly in your notes and is easily searchable!</p>

<p>🔧 <strong>Packet Tracer is your best friend</strong>: Practice, practice, practice! In my opinion, it is the only way to master most of the exam topics. Do as many labs as possible. Once you finish a lab, revisit it in the 10-15 days. It will help your understanding of the technology performed and will help you get familiar with Cisco IOS.</p>

<p>🃏 <strong>Flash Cards are great</strong>: When I started studying, I did not expect Flash Cards to play a significant role in my learning, but it's the most fun way to retain essential information. Neil's and Jeremy's courses include flashcards using the software ANKI, and I suggest you use them.</p>

<p>📚 <strong>Structure the content as it suits you</strong>: for example, while revising, I went through the topics in the following sequence: Networking Basics =&gt; Routing =&gt; VLANS &amp; Switching =&gt; Network Architectures =&gt; ACLs =&gt; NAT =&gt; Device Security =&gt; IPv6 =&gt; Cloud and VPN =&gt; Network Automation =&gt; Wireless Networking and QoS. I merged and bifurcated topics depending on what I found challenging. This made sense to me, but it might be different for you. You need to find what works for you and stick with it.</p>

<p>🔄 <strong>Stay consistent</strong>: Consistency is key in tackling the challenges of the CCNA exam. Establish a study routine and stick to it. The journey may be tough, but staying consistent with your efforts will pay off.</p>

<p>At last, All the best to everyone preparing or thinking to prepare for the CCNA. You've got this!</p>
